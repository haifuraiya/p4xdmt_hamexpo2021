Binding for the axi-clkgen clock generator

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be "adi,axi-clkgen-1.00.a" or "adi,axi-clkgen-2.00.a".
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; Should always be set to 0.
- reg : Address and length of the axi-clkgen register set.
- clocks : Phandle and clock specifier for the axi control clock and MMCM input
           clocks. The MMCM input clocks must either reference one clock if only the
	   first clock input is connected or two if both inputs are connected.
- clock-names: Should be "s_axi_aclk" for the axi control clock, and "clkin1"
	       and "clkin2" for the MMCM input clocks (only one clkin is
	       required).

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names : From common clock binding.

Example:
	clock@ff000000 {
		compatible = "adi,axi-clkgen";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0xff000000 0x1000>;
		clocks = <&clk 71>, <&osc 1>;
		clock-names = "s_axi_acl", "clkin1";
	};
